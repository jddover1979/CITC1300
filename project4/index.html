                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>Happy Pet was founded when we saw a need in one local neighboorhood to help abandonded pets find new homes.  After years of planning and searching for a headquarters, we found an old drug store building that was retrofitted with the appropriate facilities to shelter, feed and bathe new potential pets to prepare them for their new homes!
