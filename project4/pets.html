            <h2>Meet our Pets!</h2>
            <h3>Meet Mittens</h3>
            <p>This is Mittens!  She was found on alone looking for food.  We took her in, cleaned her up and now she's waiting for you to take her home.</p>
            <img src="images/cat1.jpg" alt="Meet Mittens">
            <h3>Meet Mollie</h3>
            <p>Mollie is a senior kitty who's perfect for a childless home or elderly parent.  Come and see how sweet she is!  She'd love to lay in your lap for hours!</p>
            <img src="images/cat2.jpg" alt="Meet Mollie">
            <h3>Meet Buddy</h3>
            <p>Buddy is a sweet guy who loves to play outside.  He'd be great in a home with a kitty door so that he can come and go as he pleases.</p>
            <img src="images/cat3.jpg" alt="Meet Buddy">
            <h3>Meet Rosco</h3>
            <p>Rosco loves to play in the yard and chase his ball!  Rosco doesn't like going on walks too much, so he's pretty much a homebody.</p>
            <img src="images/dog1.jpg" alt="Meet Rosco">
            <h3>Meet Rusty</h3>
            <p>Rusty likes playing with kids so he's the purfect family dog.  He'll cuddle on the couch with you on cold winter nights and likes to hog the blankets.</p>
            <img src="images/dog2.jpg" alt="Meet Rusty">
            <h3>Meet Furball</h3>
            <p>Furball is...special.  Here he's seen dressed up for Christmas WAY too close to Halloween.  Unlike Punkin' below, Furball has a proper sense of time. </p>
            <img src="images/dog3.jpg" alt="Meet Furball">
            <h3>Meet Punkin'</h3>
            <p>Punkin' is seen here picking out the purfect pumpkin for Halloween.  </p>
